# Citi Bike Data Reporting

Welcome to the Citi Bike Data Reporting project! As the lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike program, you are tasked with creating comprehensive reports and visualizations to support city officials in understanding and improving the city's bike-sharing program.

## Project Overview

The Citi Bike program has been collecting extensive data on bike utilization since 2013. This project involves generating detailed reports based on the data collected for the years 2014 and 2015. The goal is to provide actionable insights through data visualization and analysis.

## Data Sources

The data for this project was sourced from the Citi Bike Data webpage. Specifically, the project uses:

- **2014 Citi Bike Data:** Monthly zip files containing bike trip records for each month of 2014.
- **2015 Citi Bike Data:** Monthly zip files containing bike trip records for each month of 2015.
These were not able to be adde dto the Githun due to its large size.

## Data Preparation

1. **Data Extraction:**
   - Downloaded and extracted zip files for 2014 and 2015.
   - Each yearâ€™s data was divided into 12 folders, each representing a month.

2. **Data Combination:**
   - Combined extracted CSV files into a single file for each year.
   - Extracted 100 recordings from each month to ensure consistency and manageability.

3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Changed data types of specific columns to ensure accurate analysis.
   - Split columns where necessary for better data granularity.
   - Cleaned and processed the data to prepare it for visualization in Tableau.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Data Extraction and Preprocessing:** Python (Pandas)
- **Data Visualization:** Tableau
- **Data Storage:** CSV files

## Reports and Dashboards

The primary deliverable is a set of interactive dashboards and reports created in Tableau. These visualizations will provide insights into:

- Bike utilization patterns throughout 2014 and 2015.
- Trends and anomalies in bike trips.
- Key performance metrics for the Citi Bike program.
